SCons Erlang 0.0.0
==================

Scons Erlang is an add on for SCons, a mako/autotools replacement to compile Erlang projects.

It is currently in it's early development stages but it can already be useful.

There's no documentation yet. If you want to use it first learn the basics of SCons at the SCons User's Guide at http://scons.org/doc/HTML/scons-user/book1.html

Then, to learn how to use SCons Erlang itself take a look at these two project's source code (unreleased as the time of this release):

- Serlvers: http://software.pupeno.com/Serlvers
- Fanterlastic Four: http://software.pupeno.com/FanterlasticFour

Requirements
------------

You'll need:

- SCons: http://www.scons.org
- Erlang/OTP: http://www.erlang.org

Installation
------------

SCons is used to compile and install this package (the Python part is not compiled, but the Erlang part is).

First check out the variables you need to set by running: scons --help

You'll need to set:

- SCONSPREFIX: SCons prefix directory (where SCons is installed). Where you should see a directory named "SCons".
- ERLANGPREFIX: Erlang prefix directory (where Erlang is installed). Where you should see something like this: bin erts-5.4.13 Install lib misc releases usr.

For example:

$ scons SCONSPREFIX=/usr/lib/scons/ ERLANGPREFIX=/usr/lib/erlang
...
$ scons install
...

For the second case you might need sudo or su to reach root capabilities.
